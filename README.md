# Data Visualization - Engineering Studies

This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions related to basic data manipulation and visualization. The exercises are designed to develop fundamental programming skills in Python, with a focus on **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data handling and **Matplotlib** for visualizing data.

## Exercises
The repository includes solutions to various exercises, including but not limited to:

- Basic data manipulation with **NumPy** and **Pandas**
- Visualizing data with **Matplotlib**
- String manipulations and formatting
- Basic mathematical computations
- Operations with arrays and matrices
- Complex number operations
- Basic control flow (loops, conditionals)

## List of Key Exercises
- **Data Manipulation with NumPy and Pandas** - Operations like creating arrays, reshaping them, performing mathematical computations, and manipulating arrays.
- **String and List Operations** - Various tasks related to manipulating strings, lists, and working with collections of data.
- **Data Visualization** - Generating plots and charts (line plots, scatter plots, pie charts) to represent data.
- **Basic Computational Tasks** - Implementing algorithms for mathematical tasks and logical problem-solving.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dormej/data-visualization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-visualization
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed, along with the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

4. Open any `.py` file (e.g.m main.py) in your preferred text editor, then run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
